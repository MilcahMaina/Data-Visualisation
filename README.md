# Data-Visualisation
# (Prosper Loans Exploration )
## by Milcah Maina



## Dataset
> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
## Summary of Findings

> I analysed loan data from Prosper with the aim to discover which factors influenced a borrower's annual percentage rate,as well as which variables were related to the loan amount. In summary I discovered that the loan amount had a strong correlation with the Prosper Score which is a risk classification, with the customers assigned the lowest risk obtaining the highest loan amounts. Additionally, borrowers who are employed and those with higher income ranges were also able to obtain higher and or more loans.  
It was evident also that the Lender Yield and Estimated Effective Yield are both positively correlated with the APR i.e the higher a borrower's annual percentage rate, the greater the yield(return) on the loan.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The key insights I'll be focusing on are a few of the factors that have the greatest influence on the loan amount i.e meployment status and income range as well as the variables that have the greatest influence on the return on the loans.
